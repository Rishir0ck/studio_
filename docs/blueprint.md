## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: A light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC) provides a neutral and warm backdrop, reminiscent of natural linen, for a relaxed dining atmosphere.
- Primary color: A moderate, muted brown (#A67B5B) reflects earthiness and rustic charm. Its subtlety ensures it doesnâ€™t overwhelm, but instead offers a grounding presence on the screen. This color is inspired by wooden tables, and brown kraft paper menus.
- Accent color: A golden yellow (#FFC966) is used to draw attention to interactive elements and important information. This accent is inspired by the color of butter, or candlelight, so it encourages thoughts of abundance.
- Clean and readable typography for easy navigation and readability.
